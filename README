simple library for macro-discretizing audio and video streams

once media are "chunked," chunks can be analyzed as comparable units

a few features are extracted, but not too many yet

(theoretically) stable object-oriented API's are provided in python and javascript,
which provide in-progress as well as serialized representations of segment-analysis.

SegmentedSource:
  uid: str
  segments(): [Segment] (python: generator, js: cb)
  segmentAt(t): Segment

Segment:
  "dictionary-like key-value store for analysis"
  start: time
  duration: time
  index: int
  parent: SegmentedSource
  getKey(key): payload (python: numpy, javascript: cb/base64-encoded)
  keyPath(key): path to serialized representation
  keys(): 
  

segment.py depends on numm:
% apt-get install python-numm (debian wheezy)
